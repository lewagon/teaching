## How Le Wagon works ?

### karr

All the courses are here [karr.lewagon.org](http://karr.lewagon.org/). At the beginig of each day, you need to give your morning talk form here (on fullscreen).

__protip:__ during live coding session avoid to use alias or shortcuts, you can show them but one step at a time, we don’t want to loose our sudents.

When your morning course is over you can switch to kitt & introduce the exercices of the day.

### kitt

[kitt.lewagon.org](http://kitt.lewagon.org/) is our learning platform. Students work here.

__protip:__ don’t forget to turn on your status.

Please force students to make tickets when they need help. We can fix mistakes & update excercices _with real data_.

### Slack

__protip:__ As in the commit message, we talk in english here.
